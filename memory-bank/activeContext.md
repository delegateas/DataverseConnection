# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Extracted Dataverse connection logic into a reusable .NET 8 class library (DataverseConnection).
- Implemented AddDataverse extension method for IServiceCollection to provide ServiceClient via DI.
- Refactored DataverseWhoAmI CLI app to use DI and the new library.
- Maintaining up-to-date Memory Bank documentation.

## Recent Changes
- Created DataverseConnection class library targeting .NET 8.
- Added Microsoft.PowerPlatform.Dataverse.Client and Azure.Identity as dependencies.
- Implemented ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs with AddDataverse and DataverseOptions.
- Added project reference from DataverseWhoAmI to DataverseConnection.
- Refactored Program.cs in DataverseWhoAmI to use DI and AddDataverse.
- Verified successful build of both projects.

## Next Steps
- Add NuGet packaging metadata to DataverseConnection for distribution.
- Publish DataverseConnection as a NuGet package (internal or public).
- Add usage documentation and samples for AddDataverse.
- Test CLI and library integration on all supported platforms.
- Continue updating Memory Bank as project evolves.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Only DefaultAzureCredential is supported for authentication.
- Connection logic is now reusable and decoupled from CLI logic.
- DI pattern is used for ServiceClient provisioning.
- Output remains human-readable and suitable for automation.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Extension method pattern for DI registration.
- Separation of concerns: CLI logic vs. connection logic.
- Cross-platform compatibility.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Extracting connection logic into a library enables rapid reuse and standardization across .NET projects.
- DI and extension methods simplify integration and testing.
- Memory Bank ensures all architectural and implementation decisions are preserved.
