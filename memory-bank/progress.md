# Progress

## What Works
- Memory Bank documentation is fully initialized and up to date.
- Project requirements, context, architecture, and technology stack are clearly defined.
- DataverseConnection class library provides reusable AddDataverse extension method for DI.
- DataverseWhoAmI CLI app uses DI and the new library for Dataverse connectivity.
- Both projects build successfully and are ready for further testing and packaging.

## What's Left to Build
- Add NuGet packaging metadata to DataverseConnection.
- Publish DataverseConnection as a NuGet package (internal or public).
- Add usage documentation and samples for AddDataverse.
- Test CLI and library integration on all supported platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS).
- Package CLI as a dotnet tool for local/global installation (optional).

## Current Status
- Core implementation is complete: connection logic is extracted, reusable, and integrated via DI.
- Ready for NuGet packaging, documentation, and broader testing.

## Known Issues
- None at this stage.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Committed to using only DefaultAzureCredential for authentication to ensure security and modern best practices.
- Decided on minimal CLI pattern for simplicity and automation compatibility.
- Extracted connection logic into a reusable class library for rapid integration in other .NET projects.
- Adopted DI and extension method patterns for maintainability and testability.
- Documentation-first approach ensures all context is preserved for future work.
