# Progress

## What Works
- Memory Bank documentation is fully initialized and up to date.
- Project requirements, context, architecture, and technology stack are clearly defined.

## What's Left to Build
- Scaffold .NET 8 console application/dotnet tool.
- Add and configure NuGet dependencies: Microsoft.PowerPlatform.Dataverse.Client, Azure.Identity.
- Implement CLI argument parsing and environment variable support for Dataverse URL.
- Implement authentication using DefaultAzureCredential.
- Connect to Dataverse and execute WhoAmIRequest.
- Print result to console in a clear format.
- Add robust error handling and user feedback.
- Package as a dotnet tool for local/global installation.
- Test on all supported platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS).

## Current Status
- Project is in the planning/documentation phase.
- Ready to begin implementation.

## Known Issues
- None at this stage.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Committed to using only DefaultAzureCredential for authentication to ensure security and modern best practices.
- Decided on minimal CLI pattern for simplicity and automation compatibility.
- Documentation-first approach ensures all context is preserved for future work.
